      <description>Before you moved to the city, your dad was a logging worker.
He was a logging worker fourteen years before you were born and never changed his career since. His obsession with wood was known to the whole village. Your neighbor once told you jokingly: even when your mom was giving labor, your dad wanted to finish chopping the last piece of wood because he was “really feeling it.”
Working with wood was art, your dad never forgot to educate you.</description>
