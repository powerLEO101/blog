Mr. R was a born liar.
Mr. R learned how to lie when he was only six months old. When other babies were crying and begging for milk, Mr. R already mastered how to fake calmness, and then cry, so his parents would say, “this baby is promising,” and give him anything he wanted, milk, toys, and praises. Mr. R was most proud of the lie he told when he immigrated to the US.</description>

My mom told me before she was dead, that a heart attack felt like something controlling your lung, so you could only breathe out but not breathe in.

I always wanted to feel a heart attack in one of my dreams, so that I won’t be nervous if I actually get one.</description>
