I am a undergraduate student at NYU double majoring in Computer Science and Philosphy. I graduated from Kent School in 2024.

I love machine learning. After completing a research apprenticeship with a Doctorate student at Cambridge, I published a paper about self-supervised learning with metadata from MRI scans at Horizon in-house journal. After that, I started competiting on Kaggle, a machine learning competition platform. Now I have 2 silver medal.

I love writing. I completed two summer camps at Columbia University for Creative Writing. I wrote poems and short stories. It helped me reflect life.
