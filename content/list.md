| __Sicario__ | Jun/26/24 | 3.5 | 1 | Cold blooded, good thriller, good match with Villenueve's visual style. Was tense the entire time. |
| __Reservoir Dogs__ | Jun/12/24 | 4 | 2 | Reasonably, not Quentin's best, but still, extremely powerful, and legendary. |
| __The Life of Chuck__ | Jun/10/25 | 4.5 | 1 | Bullet in the Brain |
| __The Phoenician Scheme__ | Jun/6/25 | 4 | 1 | Clearly Wes Anderson styled, need to rewatch. |
