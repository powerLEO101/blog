| __Eddington__| Jul/21/25 | 4 | 1 | Explaining yourself (especially online) in the age of information is a negative feedback loop. |
| __No Country for Old Man__| Jul/19/25 | 4.5 | 4 | I disagree that it's a movie about the evil. It is about so many things. This time it struck me as a movie about nature, of which ugliness below the man-made abstraction exists. |
| __Superman__| Jul/14/25 | 4 | 1 | It is amazing. It doesn't even matter what the plot is. It just makes me hopeful |
| __The Usual Suspect__| Jul/11/25 | 4 | 1 | Good. |
| __The French Dispatch__| Jul/10/25 | 4.5 | 1 | Need to rewatch. The prisoner painter story. Wow. |
| __Asteriod City__| Jun/30/25 | 4 | 1 | Life is a play in a play in which you find love. |
| __The F1 Movie__ | Jun/30/25 | 3 | 1 | Definitely has its flaws. Dialog feels like bad anime, is mechenical. But the overall movie is surprisingly engaging and entertaining for a non-F1 fan like me. |
| __Sicario__ | Jun/26/25 | 4 | 1 | Cold blooded, good thriller, good match with Villenueve's visual style. Was tense the entire time. Alejandro reminds me of Anton Chigurh. |
| __Reservoir Dogs__ | Jun/12/25 | 4 | 2 | Reasonably, not Quentin's best, but still, extremely powerful, and legendary. |
| __The Life of Chuck__ | Jun/10/25 | 4.5 | 1 | Bullet in the Brain. |
| __The Phoenician Scheme__ | Jun/6/25 | 4 | 1 | Need to rewatch. |
